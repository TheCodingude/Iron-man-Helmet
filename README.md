# My Stem Project


## im trying to recreate an iron man helmet as well as a 16 year without a job can aka im going 3d print a helmet and put a rasberry pi in it

<br>

## i will have object files in here in the future once i get to modeling the helmet

<br>

that includes jarvis 



<hr>


### i still need to find a object detection model becuase i cant get the one that i was going to use

<br>

## i have decided that v1 wont have object detection even though it would be very cool its also very expensive and i dont know enough about it to make my own model


also i dont really dont know markdown lol
